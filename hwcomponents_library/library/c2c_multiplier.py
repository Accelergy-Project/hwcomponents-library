    Energy is consumed when: 1. A increases, and all the B capacitors are charged 2. Any
    B bit goes 0->1, and the corresponding capacitor is charged

    USAGE: In your architecture, initialize a both a C2CMultiplier and a
    C2CMultiplierPortB. Have the "a" port process the analog operand and have the "b"
    port process the digital operand.

    The C2CMultiplier component has area and leak power accounted for. The
    C2CMultiplierPortB component does not have any area or leak power!
